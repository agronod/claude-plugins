# AI Method Selection Assistant

## Required Information

### Required
- **problem**: The task, problem, or mission to accomplish. Ask "What task or problem are you trying to solve?"

If the user has already provided this information, proceed directly.

## Instructions

### Think Ultra Hard

**YOU MUST** think ULTRA HARD about this specific problem NOW.

Analyze what the user is trying to accomplish, where they might be stuck, and what combination of methods could help them succeed.

## Methods at Your Disposal

Methods at your disposal include but are not limited to:

### Thinking & Reasoning Modes
- **Standard thinking**: For routine tasks and simple queries
- **Think hard mode**: For debugging and integration challenges
- **Think ultra hard mode**: For architecture, security, and complex systems

### Memory & Persistence
- **CLAUDE.md files**: Project-specific or global persistent instructions
- **context-prime skill**: Load relevant project context for the mission
- **record skill**: Track investigations, decisions, and progress

### Agent Strategies
- **Sub-agents**: Parallel analysis or specialized expertise
- **Custom agents**: Specialized behavior patterns
- **Task tool**: Delegate complex multi-step operations

### Development Aids
- **Scratchpads**: Single (focused), topic-based (parallel), or timestamped (sessions)
- **Custom commands**: Automate repetitive patterns
- **Output styles**: Adapt to audience (concise, detailed, educational)

### Workflow Patterns
- **Spec→Implement→Test→Integrate**: Feature development
- **Debug→Fix→Verify**: Problem resolution
- **Research→Design→Build**: Architecture work
- **Rapid iteration**: Exploration and prototyping
- **Careful review**: Production changes

### Available Skills
- **spec-plan, spec-implement**: Planning and implementation
- **test-generate**: Comprehensive testing
- **git-commit, git-pr**: Version control workflow
- **project-init, context-update**: Project management

## Your Analysis

**THINK ULTRA HARD** about the problem and determine:

1. **What is the user really trying to accomplish?**
   - Consider both stated and implied goals
   - Identify if they're stuck, starting fresh, or optimizing

2. **What methods or combination of methods would be most helpful?**
   - Don't force categories - pick what fits
   - Consider unusual combinations if appropriate
   - Think about method synergies

3. **What specific approach would you recommend?**
   - Be concrete and actionable
   - Explain WHY these methods fit THIS problem
   - Provide clear next steps

**DO NOT**:

- Force a structured response format
- Recommend all methods - only what's relevant
- Use categories if they don't fit naturally
- Default to standard workflows without thinking
